# NanoTransport Protocol Snippets

This repo includes snippets for various Programmable Transport Protocols that are deployed on hardware for extremely low latency in data centers. Ideally, for the bounded packet processing latency, the snippets would run on a NIC/CPU architecture such as nanoPU [1] to achieve high performance.
